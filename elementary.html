            <p class="light">The Alegria Montessori elementary classroom  focuses on four major components: basic academics (meeting Montessori and state guidelines ), The Great Lessons, “going out”, and community service. Our academic standards are set with the high expectations of our teachers to assist your child in understanding the concepts of learning through the materials we provide, and then into abstraction. The Great Lessons are stories that Montessori developed  in order to generate a child’s interest in science, history, and culture.<br><br>Our “going out” concept helps your child understand community resources and how to use them by researching topics, for example cultures and languages, that they learn each semester. This allows them to discover the topics discussed in class in depth, further expanding their need and desire to want to know more about the world around them. Our last concept, community service, is exactly that. We help encourage your children to find a community project, to research that project, and then to follow through with active involvement.</p>
